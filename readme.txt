Our project works smoothly and successfully prints the graph we created and the minimum spanning tree produced from Kruskal's 
algorithm. The runtime for Kruskal algorithm is O(E log E) and not O(E log V). As, the edges have to be sorted first and it 
takes O(E log E) where it dominates the runtime for verifying whether the edge in consideration is a safe edge or not 
which would take O(E log V).

Additionally, we didn't really find many academic or scholarly articles to put in our works cited page. Most of our
research was done on more commonly found websites. We did add the one more academic source we found, however.
