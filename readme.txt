Our project works smoothly and successfully prints the graph we created and the minimum spanning tree produced from Kruskal's 
algorithm. The program runs the algorithm autonomously and prints the output. The runtime for Kruskal algorithm is O(E log E) 
and not O(E log V). As, the edges have to be sorted first and it takes O(E log E) where it dominates the runtime for 
verifying whether the edge in consideration is a safe edge or not which would take O(E log V).
